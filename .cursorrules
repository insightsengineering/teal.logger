# Testing instructions

## General Principles

- **Only public functions are tested** - Internal/private functions should be tested via public methods.

- **Utilities should be tested via public methods** - Don't test internal utilities directly.

## Test Structure

- **Short tests with precise information** - Please have a look at `test-module_teal.R` in the `teal` package to follow the convention found there.

- **Each test should be encapsulated in single `test_that()/it()`** - Ideally one expectation per `test_that/it` unless test-description says otherwise.

- **Use `testthat::describe()` and `it()` for grouping** - Group related tests together using `describe()` blocks, with individual tests as `it()` blocks.

  Example:
  ```r
  testthat::describe("function_name behavior", {
    it("does X correctly", {
      testthat::expect_equal(function_name(), expected_value)
    })
    
    it("handles Y correctly", {
      testthat::expect_error(function_name(invalid_input))
    })
  })
  ```

- **Alternative: Use `testthat::test_that()`** - Can also use `test_that()` directly if preferred, following the same one-expectation-per-test principle.
